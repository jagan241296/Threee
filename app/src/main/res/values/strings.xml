    <string name="aboutus">IGI started the Indira International Innovation Summit in 2008 with an aim to promote the Industry – academia linkages to enable the Indira College of Engineering and Management (ICEM), Pune to emerge as a Leading technical manpower source, but today this summit has become a platform for rekindling the power of creativity and innovations which would drive future innovation in the Industry.\n
    We are living in the era of “Digital India” where the entire country is in the process of getting digitalized. \n
        Innovation functions as a stimulus for the growth of the industries and eventually development of the society making people’s lives easier and more comfortable.\n
        We, at ICEM, strongly believe that innovation become a sine qua non for the very survival of any business and therefore nurture a culture of thinking out-of-the-box towards creating a successful career, amongst the students pursuing various professional courses within the institute.\n
        The 9th 3I Summit aimed to offer a great learning experience to the students of Indira and to imbibe the spirit of innovation in them. The wealth of knowledge and experience available at the summit served as a motivation for the young generation at Indira, to realize the value of innovation and to benefit from the presence of ace practitioners.\n
